    "# How to Use Statistics to Identify Outliers in Data\n",
    "When modeling, it is important to clean the data sample to ensure that the observations best represent the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a dataset can contain extreme values that are outside the range of what is expected and unlike the other data. These are called outliers and often machine learning modeling and model skill in general can be improved by understanding and even removing these outlier values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover more about outliers and two statistical methods that you can use to identify and filter outliers from your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* That an outlier is an unlikely observation in a dataset and may have one of many causes.\n",
    "* That standard deviation can be used to identify outliers in Gaussian or Gaussian-like data.\n",
    "* That the interquartile range can be used to identify outliers in data regardless of the distribution.\n",

    "1. What are Outliers?\n",
    "2. Test Dataset\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation Method\n",
    "4. Interquartile Range Method"

    "## What are Outliers?\n",
    "An outlier is an observation that is unlike the other observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is rare, or distinct, or does not fit in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can have many causes, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measurement or input error.\n",
    "* Data corruption.\n",
    "* True outlier observation (e.g. Michael Jordan in basketball).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no precise way to define and identify outliers in general because of the specifics of each dataset. Instead, you, or a domain expert, must interpret the raw observations and decide whether a value is an outlier or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we can use statistical methods to identify observations that appear to be rare or unlikely given the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that the values identified are outliers and should be removed. But, the tools described in this tutorial can be helpful in shedding light on rare events that may require a second look.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good tip is to consider plotting the identified outlier values, perhaps in the context of non-outlier values to see if there are any systematic relationship or pattern to the outliers. If there is, perhaps they are not outliers and can be explained, or perhaps the outliers themselves can be identified more systematically."

    "\n",
    "Numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution will have outliers. That is, by virtue of the distribution itself, there will be a few values that will be a long way from the mean, rare values that we can identify as outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the randn() function to generate random Gaussian values with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, then multiply the results by our own standard deviation and add the mean to shift the values into the preferred range.\n",

    "Running the example generates the sample and then prints the mean and standard deviation. As expected, the values are very close to the expected values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviation Method\n",
    "If we know that the distribution of values in the sample is Gaussian or Gaussian-like, we can use the standard deviation of the sample as a cut-off for identifying outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian distribution has the property that the standard deviation from the mean can be used to reliably summarize the percentage of values in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, within one standard deviation of the mean will cover 68% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 5, as in the test dataset above, then all data in the sample between 45 and 55 will account for about 68% of the data sample. We can cover more of the data sample if we expand the range as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 Standard Deviation from the Mean: 68%\n",
    "* 2 Standard Deviations from the Mean: 95%\n",
    "* 3 Standard Deviations from the Mean: 99.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "A value that falls outside of 3 standard deviations is part of the distribution, but it is an unlikely or rare event at approximately 1 in 370 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three standard deviations from the mean is a common cut-off in practice for identifying outliers in a Gaussian or Gaussian-like distribution. For smaller samples of data, perhaps a value of 2 standard deviations (95%) can be used, and for larger samples, perhaps a value of 4 standard deviations (99.9%) can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s make this concrete with a worked example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the data is standardized first (e.g. to a Z-score with zero mean and unit variance) so that the outlier detection can be performed using standard Z-score cut-off values. This is a convenience and is not required in general, and we will perform the calculations in the original scale of the data here to make things clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the mean and standard deviation of a given sample, then calculate the cut-off for identifying outliers as more than 3 standard deviations from the mean."

    "\n",

The 50th percentile is the middle value, or the average of the two middle values for an even number of examples. If we had 10,000 samples, then the 50th percentile would be the average of the 5000th and 5001st values.\n",

    "\n",
    "The IQR can be used to identify outliers by defining limits on the sample values that are a factor k of the IQR below the 25th percentile or above the 75th percentile.

A factor k of 3 or more can be used to identify values that are extreme outliers or “far outs” when described in the context of box and whisker plots.\n",
