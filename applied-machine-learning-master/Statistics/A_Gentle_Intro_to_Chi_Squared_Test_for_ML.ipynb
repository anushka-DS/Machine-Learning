    "# A Gentle Introduction to the Chi-Squared Test for Machine Learning\n",
    "A common problem in applied machine learning is determining whether input features are relevant to the outcome to be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the problem of feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of classification problems where input variables are also categorical, we can use statistical tests to determine whether the output variable is dependent or independent of the input variables. If independent, then the input variable is a candidate for a feature that may be irrelevant to the problem and removed from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson’s chi-squared statistical hypothesis is an example of a test for independence between categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover the chi-squared statistical hypothesis test for quantifying the independence of pairs of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pairs of categorical variables can be summarized using a contingency table.\n",

    "A categorical variable is a variable that may take on one of a set of labels.\n",

    "We may wish to look at a summary of a categorical variable as it pertains to another categorical variable. For example, sex and interest, where interest may have the labels ‘science‘, ‘math‘, or ‘art‘. We can collect observations from people collected with regard to these two categorical variables; for example:"

    "The table was called a contingency table, by Karl Pearson, because the intent is to help determine whether one variable is contingent upon or depends upon the other variable. For example, does an interest in math or science depend on gender, or are they independent?\n",

    "This is challenging to determine from the table alone; instead, we can use a statistical method called the Pearson’s Chi-Squared test.\n",

    "## Pearson’s Chi-Squared Test\n",
    "The Pearson’s Chi-Squared test, or just Chi-Squared test for short, is named for Karl Pearson, although there are variations on the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Squared test is a statistical hypothesis test that assumes (the null hypothesis) that the observed frequencies for a categorical variable match the expected frequencies for the categorical variable. The test calculates a statistic that has a chi-squared distribution, named for the Greek capital letter Chi (X) pronounced “ki” as in kite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the Sex/Interest example above, the number of observations for a category (such as male and female) may or may not the same. Nevertheless, we can calculate the expected frequency of observations in each Interest group and see whether the partitioning of interests by Sex results in similar or different frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Squared test does this for a contingency table, first calculating the expected frequencies for the groups, then determining whether the division of the groups, called the observed frequencies, matches the expected frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the test is a test statistic that has a chi-squared distribution and can be interpreted to reject or fail to reject the assumption or null hypothesis that the observed and expected frequencies are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables are considered independent if the observed and expected frequencies are similar, that the levels of the variables do not interact, are not dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the test statistic in the context of the chi-squared distribution with the requisite number of degress of freedom as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If Statistic >= Critical Value**: significant result, reject null hypothesis (H0), dependent.\n",
    "* **If Statistic < Critical Value**: not significant result, fail to reject null hypothesis (H0), independent.\n",
