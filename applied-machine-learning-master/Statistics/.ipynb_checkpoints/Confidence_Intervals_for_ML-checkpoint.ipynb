    "# Confidence Intervals for Machine Learning\n",
    "Much of machine learning involves estimating the performance of a machine learning algorithm on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are a way of quantifying the uncertainty of an estimate. They can be used to add a bounds or likelihood on a population parameter, such as a mean, estimated from a sample of independent observations from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover confidence intervals and how to calculate confidence intervals in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* That a confidence interval is a bounds on an estimate of a population parameter.\n",
    "* That the confidence interval for the estimated skill of a classification method can be calculated directly.\n",
    "* That the confidence interval for any arbitrary population statistic can be estimated in a distribution-free way using the bootstrap.\n",

    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into 3 parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is a Confidence Interval?\n",
    "2. Interval for Classification Accuracy\n",
    "3. Nonparametric Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Confidence Interval?\n",
    "A confidence interval is a bounds on the estimate of a population variable. It is an interval statistic used to quantify the uncertainty on an estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is different from a tolerance interval that describes the bounds of data sampled from the distribution. It is also different from a prediction interval that describes the bounds on a single observation. Instead, the confidence interval provides bounds on a population parameter, such as a mean, standard deviation, or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In applied machine learning, we may wish to use confidence intervals in the presentation of the skill of a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a confidence interval could be used in presenting the skill of a classification model, which could be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Given the sample, there is a 95% likelihood that the range x to y covers the true model accuracy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "*The accuracy of the model was x +/- y at the 95% confidence level.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals can also be used in the presentation of the error of a regression predictive model; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*There is a 95% likelihood that the range x to y covers the true error of the model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "*The error of the model was x +/- y at the 95% confidence level.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of 95% confidence is very common in presenting confidence intervals, although other less common values are used, such as 90% and 99.7%. In practice, you can use any value you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a confidence interval is its ability to quantify the uncertainty of the estimate. It provides both a lower and upper bound and a likelihood. Taken as a radius measure alone, the confidence interval is often referred to as the margin of error and may be used to graphically depict the uncertainty of an estimate on graphs through the use of error bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the larger the sample from which the estimate was drawn, the more precise the estimate and the smaller (better) the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller Confidence Interval: A more precise estimate.\n",
    "* Larger Confidence Interval: A less precise estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals belong to a field of statistics called estimation statistics that can be used to present and interpret experimental results instead of, or in addition to, statistical significance tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals may be preferred in practice over the use of statistical significance tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that they are easier for practitioners and stakeholders to relate directly to the domain. They can also be interpreted and used to compare machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what a confidence interval is, let’s look at a few ways that we can calculate them for predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interval for Classification Accuracy\n",
    "Classification problems are those where a label or class outcome variable is predicted given some input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to use classification accuracy or classification error (the inverse of accuracy) to describe the skill of a classification predictive model. For example, a model that makes correct predictions of the class outcome variable 75% of the time has a classification accuracy of 75%, calculated as:"

    "Classification accuracy or classification error is a proportion or a ratio. It describes the proportion of correct or incorrect predictions made by the model. Each prediction is a binary decision that could be correct or incorrect. Technically, this is called a Bernoulli trial, named for Jacob Bernoulli. The proportions in a Bernoulli trial have a specific distribution called a binomial distribution. Thankfully, with large sample sizes (e.g. more than 30), we can approximate the distribution with a Gaussian.\n",
