    "# A Gentle Introduction to Effect Size Measures in Python\n",
    "Statistical hypothesis tests report on the likelihood of the observed results given an assumption, such as no association between variables or no difference between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis tests do not comment on the size of the effect if the association or difference is statistically significant. This highlights the need for standard ways of calculating and reporting a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect size methods refer to a suite of statistical tools for quantifying an the size of an effect in the results of experiments that can be used to complement the results from statistical hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover effect size and effect size measures for quantifying the magnitude of a result.\n",

    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",

    "* The importance of calculating and reporting effect size in the results of experiments.\n",
    "* Effect size measures for quantifying the association between variables, such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient.\n",

    "## The Need to Report Effect Size\n",
    "Once practitioners become versed in statistical methods, it is common to become focused on quantifying the likelihood of a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often seen with the calculation and presentation of the results from statistical hypothesis tests in terms of p-value and the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect that is often neglected in the presentation of results is to actually quantify the difference or relationship, called the effect. It can be easy to forget that the intention of an experiment is to quantify an effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical test can only comment on the likelihood that there is an effect. It does not comment on the size of the effect. The results of an experiment could be significant, but the effect so small that it has little consequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with neglecting the presentation of the effect is that it may be calculated using ad hoc measures or even ignored completely and left to the reader to interpret. This is a big problem as quantifying the size of the effect is essential to interpreting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is Effect Size?\n",
    "An effect size refers to the size or magnitude of an effect or result as it would be expected to occur in a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect size is estimated from samples of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect size methods refers to a collection of statistical tools used to calculate the effect size. Often the field of effect size measures is referred to as simply “effect size“, to note the general concern of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to organize effect size statistical methods into groups, based on the type of effect that is to be quantified. Two main groups of methods for calculating effect size are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Association**. Statistical methods for quantifying an association between variables (e.g. correlation).\n",
    "* **Difference**. Statistical methods for quantifying the difference between variables (e.g. difference between means).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of an effect size calculation must be interpreted, and it depends on the specific statistical method used. A measure must be chosen based on the goals of the interpretation. Three types of calculated result include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standardized Result**. The effect size has a standard scale allowing it to be interpreted generally regardless of application (e.g. Cohen’s d calculation).\n",
    "* **Original Units Result**. The effect size may use the original units of the variable, which can aid in the interpretation within the domain (e.g. difference between two sample means).\n",
    "* **Unit Free Result**. The effect size may not have units such as a count or proportion (e.g. a correlation coefficient).\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be a good idea to report an effect size using multiple measures to aide the different types of readers of your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect size does not replace the results of a statistical hypothesis test. Instead, the effect size complements the test. Ideally, the results of both the hypothesis test and the effect size calculation would be presented side-by-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hypothesis Test**: Quantify the likelihood of observing the data given an assumption (null hypothesis).\n",
    "* **Effect Size**: Quantify the size of the effect assuming that the effect is present."

    "## How to Calculate Effect Size\n",
    "The calculation of an effect size could be the calculation of a mean of a sample or the absolute difference between two means. It could also be a more elaborate statistical calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will look at some common effect size calculations for both associations and differences. The examples of methods is not complete; there may be 100s of methods that can be used to calculate an effect size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculate Association Effect Size\n",
    "The association between variables is often referred to as the “r family” of effect size methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This name comes from perhaps the most common method for calculating the effect size called Pearson’s correlation coefficient, also called Pearson’s r.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson’s correlation coefficient measures the degree of linear association between two real-valued variables. It is a unit-free effect size measure, that can be interpreted in a standard way, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* -1.0: Perfect negative relationship.\n",
    "* -0.7: Strong negative relationship\n",
    "* -0.5: Moderate negative relationship\n",
    "* -0.3: Weak negative relationship\n",
    "* 0.0: No relationship.\n",
    "* 0.3: Weak positive relationship\n",
    "* 0.5: Moderate positive relationship\n",
    "* 0.7: Strong positive relationship\n",
    "* 1.0: Perfect positive relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be calculated in Python using the pearsonr() SciPy function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below demonstrates the calculation of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient to quantify the size of the association between two samples of random Gaussian numbers where one sample has a strong relationship with the second."
