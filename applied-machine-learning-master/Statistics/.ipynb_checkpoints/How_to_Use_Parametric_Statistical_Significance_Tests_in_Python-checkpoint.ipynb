    "# How to Use Parametric Statistical Significance Tests in Python\n",

    "\n",
    "in applied machine learning, we need to compare data samples, specifically the mean of the samples. Perhaps to see if one technique performs better than another on one or more datasets. To quantify this question and interpret the results, we can use parametric hypothesis testing methods such as the Student’s t-test and ANOVA.\n",

    "## Parametric Statistical Significance Tests\n",
    "Parametric statistical tests assume that a data sample was drawn from a specific population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "They often refer to statistical tests that assume the Gaussian distribution. Because it is so common for data to fit this distribution, parametric statistical methods are more commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical question we may have about two or more samples of data is whether they have the same distribution. Parametric statistical significance tests are those statistical methods that assume data comes from the same Gaussian distribution, that is a data distribution with the same mean and standard deviation: the parameters of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each test calculates a test statistic that must be interpreted with some background in statistics and a deeper knowledge of the statistical test itself. Tests also return a p-value that can be used to interpret the result of the test. The p-value can be thought of as the probability of observing the two data samples given the base assumption (null hypothesis) that the two samples were drawn from a population with the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value can be interpreted in the context of a chosen significance level called alpha. A common value for alpha is 5%, or 0.05. If the p-value is below the significance level, then the test says there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and that the samples were likely drawn from populations with differing distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* p <= alpha: reject H0, different distribution.\n",
    "* p > alpha: accept H0, same distribution."

    "\n",
    "We will generate two samples drawn from different distributions. Each sample will be drawn from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the randn() NumPy function to generate a sample of 100 Gaussian random numbers in each sample with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Observations in the first sample are scaled to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. Observations in the second sample are scaled to have a mean of 51 and a standard deviation of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the statistical tests to discover that the samples were drawn from differing distributions, although the small sample size of 100 observations per sample will add some noise to this decision.\n",
