    "3. How to Use Critical Values\n",

    "## Why Do We Need Critical Values?\n",
    "Many statistical hypothesis tests return a p-value that is used to interpret the outcome of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tests do not return a p-value, requiring an alternative method for interpreting the calculated test statistic directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistic calculated by a statistical hypothesis test can be interpreted using critical values from the distribution of the test statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of statistical hypothesis tests and their distributions from which critical values can be calculated are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Z-Test**: Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "* **Student t-Test**: Student’s t-distribution.\n",
    "* **Chi-Squared Test**: Chi-Squared distribution.\n",
    "* **ANOVA**: F-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical values are also used when defining intervals for expected (or unexpected) observations in distributions. Calculating and using critical values may be appropriate when quantifying the uncertainty of estimated statistics or intervals such as confidence intervals and tolerance intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Critical Value?\n",
    "A critical value is defined in the context of the population distribution and a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "An observation from the population with a value equal to or lesser than a critical value with the given probability.\n",

    "Critical values provide an alternative and equivalent way to interpret statistical hypothesis tests to the p-value.\n",

    "## How to Use Critical Values\n",
    "Calculated critical values are used as a threshold for interpreting the result of a statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation values in the population beyond the critical value are often called the “critical region” or the “region of rejection“.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical test may be one-tailed or two-tailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-Tailed Test\n",
    "A one-tailed test has a single critical value, such as on the left or the right of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, a one-tailed test has a critical value on the right of the distribution for non-symmetrical distributions (such as the Chi-Squared distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistic is compared to the calculated critical value. If the statistic is less than or equal to the critical value, the null hypothesis of the statistical test is failed to be rejected. Otherwise it is rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize this interpretation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test Statistic < Critical Value**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis of the statistical test.\n",
    "* **Test Statistic => Critical Value**: Reject the null hypothesis of the statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Tailed Test\n",
    "A two-tailed test has two critical values, one on each side of the distribution, which is often assumed to be symmetrical (e.g. Gaussian and Student-t distributions.).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a two-tailed test, a significance level (or alpha) used in the calculation of the critical values must be divided by 2. The critical value will then use a portion of this alpha on each side of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this concrete, consider an alpha of 5%. This would be split to give two alpha values of 2.5% on either side of the distribution with an acceptance area in the middle of the distribution of 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can refer to each critical value as the lower and upper critical values for the left and right of the distribution respectively. Test statistic values more than or equal to the lower critical value and less than or equal to the upper critical value indicate the failure to reject the null hypothesis. Whereas test statistic values less than the lower critical value and more than the upper critical value indicate rejection of the null hypothesis for the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize this interpretation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lower CR < Test Statistic < Upper CR**: Failure to reject the null hypothesis of the statistical test.\n",
    "* **Test Statistic <= Lower CR OR Test Statistic >= Upper CR**: Reject the null hypothesis of the statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the distribution of the test statistic is symmetric around a mean of zero, then we can shortcut the check by comparing the absolute (positive) value of the test statistic to the upper critical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **|Test Statistic| < Upper Critical Value**: Failure to reject the null hypothesis of the statistical test.\n",
    "Where |Test Statistic| is the absolute value of the calculated test statistic."

    "* **Cumulative Density Function (CDF)**: Returns the probability for an observation equal to or lesser than a specific value from the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate a critical value, we require a function that, given a probability (or significance), will return the observation value from the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we require the inverse of the cumulative density function, where given a probability, we are given the observation value that is less than or equal to the probability. This is called the percent point function (PPF), or more generally the quantile function.\n",
