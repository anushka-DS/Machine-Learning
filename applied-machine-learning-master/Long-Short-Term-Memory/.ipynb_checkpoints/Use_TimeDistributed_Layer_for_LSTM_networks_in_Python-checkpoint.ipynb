    "# How to Use the TimeDistributed Layer for Long Short-Term Memory Networks in Python\n",
    "Long Short-Term Networks or LSTMs are a popular and powerful type of Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be quite difficult to configure and apply to arbitrary sequence prediction problems, even with well defined and “easy to use” interfaces like those provided in the Keras deep learning library in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason for this difficulty in Keras is the use of the TimeDistributed wrapper layer and the need for some LSTM layers to return sequences rather than single values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover different ways to configure LSTM networks for sequence prediction, the role that the TimeDistributed layer plays, and exactly how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to design a one-to-one LSTM for sequence prediction.\n",
    "* How to design a many-to-one LSTM for sequence prediction without the TimeDistributed Layer.\n",
    "* How to design a many-to-many LSTM for sequence prediction with the TimeDistributed Layer.\n",

    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into 5 parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TimeDistributed Layer\n",
    "2. Sequence Learning Problem\n",
    "3. One-to-One LSTM for Sequence Prediction\n",
    "4. Many-to-One LSTM for Sequence Prediction (without TimeDistributed)\n",
    "5. Many-to-Many LSTM for Sequence Prediction (with TimeDistributed)\n",
    "\n",
    "## TimeDistributed Layer\n",
    "LSTMs are powerful, but hard to use and hard to configure, especially for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "An added complication is the [TimeDistributed Layer](https://keras.io/layers/wrappers/#timedistributed) (and the former TimeDistributedDense layer) that is cryptically described as a layer wrapper:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"This wrapper allows us to apply a layer to every temporal slice of an input.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "How and when are you supposed to use this wrapper with LSTMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion is compounded when you search through discussions about the wrapper layer on the Keras GitHub issues and StackOverflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the issue “[When and How to use TimeDistributedDense,](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/1029)” fchollet (Keras’ author) explains:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"TimeDistributedDense applies a same Dense (fully-connected) operation to every timestep of a 3D tensor.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes perfect sense if you already understand what the TimeDistributed layer is for and when to use it, but is no help at all to a beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to clear up confusion around using the TimeDistributed wrapper with LSTMs with worked examples that you can inspect, run, and play with to help your concrete understanding."
