    "In this section, we will go over some less obvious notations for basic arithmetic as well as a few concepts you may have forgotten since school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Arithmetic\n",
    "The notation for basic arithmetic is as you would write it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Addition: 1 + 1 = 2\n",
    "* Subtraction: 2 – 1 = 1\n",
    "* Multiplication: 2 x 2 = 4\n",
    "* Division: 2 / 2 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Most mathematical operations have a sister operation that performs the inverse operation; for example, subtraction is the inverse of addition and division is the inverse of multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algebra\n",
    "We often want to describe operations abstractly to separate them from specific data or specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason we see heavy use of algebra: that is uppercase and/or lowercase letters or words to represents terms or concepts in mathematical notation. It is also common to use letters from the Greek alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sub-field of math may have reserved letters: that is terms or letters that always mean the same thing. Nevertheless, algebraic terms should be defined as part of the description and if they are not, it may just be a poor description, not your fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication Notation\n",
    "Multiplication is a common notation and has a few short hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often a little “x” or an asterisk “*” is used to represent multiplication:"

    "### Indexing\n",
    "A key to reading notation for sequences is the notation of indexing elements in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the notation will specify the beginning and end of the sequence, such as 1 to n, where n will be the extent or length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Items in the sequence are index by a variable such as i, j, k as a subscript. This is just like array notation.\n",

    "There is other notation that you may come across.\n",
    "\n",
    "I try to lay some of it out in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to define a method in the abstract and then define it again as a specific implementation with separate notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are estimating a variable x, we may represent it using a notation that modifies the x; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* x-bar\n",
    "* x-prime\n",
    "* x-hat\n",
    "\n",
    "The same notation may have a different meaning in a different context, such as use on different objects or sub-fields of mathematics. For example, a common point of confusion is |x|, which, depending on context, can mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "* |x|: The absolute or positive value of x.\n",
    "* |x|: The length of the vector x.\n",
    "* |x|: The cardinality of the set x.\n",

    "* Linear Algebra.\n",
    "* Statistics.\n",

    "## 5 Tips for Getting Help with Math Notation\n",
    "This section lists some tips that you can use when you are struggling with mathematical notation in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Think About the Author\n",
    "People wrote the paper or book you are reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "People that can make mistakes, make omissions, and even make things confusing because they don’t fully understand what they are writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relax the constraints of the notation you are reading slightly and think about the intent of the author. What are they trying to get across?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you can even contact the author via email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc., and seek clarification. Remember that academics want other people to understand and use their work (mostly).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check Wikipedia\n",
    "Wikipedia has lists of notation which can help narrow down on the meaning or intent of the notation you are reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two places I recommend you start are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [List of mathematical symbols on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols)\n",
    "* [Greek letters used in mathematics, science, and engineering on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_letters_used_in_mathematics,_science,_and_engineering)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sketch in Code\n",
    "Mathematical operations are just functions on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map everything you’re reading to pseudocode with variables, for-loops, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to use a scripting language as you go, along with small arrays of contrived data or even an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "As your reading and understanding of the technique improves, your code-sketch of the technique will make more sense, and at the end you will have a mini prototype to play with.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never used to take much stock in this approach until I saw an academic sketch out a very complex paper in a few lines of matlab with some contrived data. It knocked my socks off because I believed the system had to be coded completely and run with a “real” dataset and that the only option was to get the original code and data. I was very wrong. Also, looking back, the guy was gifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I now use this method all the time and sketch techniques in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seek Alternatives\n",
    "There is a trick I use when I’m trying to understand a new technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find and read all the papers that reference the paper I’m reading with the new technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading other academics interpretation and re-explanation of the technique can often clarify my misunderstandings in the original description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not always though. Sometimes it can muddy the waters and introduce misleading explanations or new notation. But more often than not, it helps. After circling back to the original paper and re-reading it, I can often find cases where subsequent papers have actually made errors and misinterpretations of the original method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post a Question\n",
    "There are places online where people love to explain math to others. Seriously!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider taking a screenshot of the notation you are struggling with, write out the full reference or link to it, and post it and your area of misunderstanding to a question-and-answer site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two great places to start are:\n",
