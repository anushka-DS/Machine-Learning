    "# A Gentle Introduction to Singular-Value Decomposition for Machine Learning\n",
    "Matrix decomposition, also known as matrix factorization, involves describing a given matrix using its constituent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most known and widely used matrix decomposition method is the Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD. All matrices have an SVD, which makes it more stable than other methods, such as the eigendecomposition. As such, it is often used in a wide array of applications including compressing, denoising, and data reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover the Singular-Value Decomposition method for decomposing a matrix into its constituent elements.\n",
