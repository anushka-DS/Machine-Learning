    "# A Gentle Introduction to Sparse Matrices for Machine Learning\n",
    "Matrices that contain mostly zero values are called sparse, distinct from matrices where most of the values are non-zero, called dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large sparse matrices are common in general and especially in applied machine learning, such as in data that contains counts, data encodings that map categories to counts, and even in whole subfields of machine learning such as natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is computationally expensive to represent and work with sparse matrices as though they are dense, and much improvement in performance can be achieved by using representations and operations that specifically handle the matrix sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will discover sparse matrices, the issues they present, and how to work with them directly in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* That sparse matrices contain mostly zero values and are distinct from dense matrices.\n",
    "* The myriad of areas where you are likely to encounter sparse matrices in data, data preparation, and sub-fields of machine learning.\n",
    "* That there are many efficient ways to store and work with sparse matrices and SciPy provides implementations that you can use directly.\n",

    "## Problems with Sparsity\n",
    "Sparse matrices can cause problems with regards to space and time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "Very large matrices require a lot of memory, and some very large matrices that we wish to work with are sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a very large matrix that is too large to be stored in memory is a link matrix that shows the links from one website to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a smaller sparse matrix might be a word or term occurrence matrix for words in one book against all known words in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the matrix contained is sparse with many more zero values than data values. The problem with representing these sparse matrices as dense matrices is that memory is required and must be allocated for each 32-bit or even 64-bit zero value in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly a waste of memory resources as those zero values do not contain any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "Assuming a very large sparse matrix can be fit into memory, we will want to perform operations on this matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, if the matrix contains mostly zero-values, i.e. no data, then performing operations across this matrix may take a long time where the bulk of the computation performed will involve adding or multiplying zero values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem of increased time complexity of matrix operations that increases with the size of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is compounded when we consider that even trivial machine learning methods may require many operations on each row, column, or even across the entire matrix, resulting in vastly longer execution times."

    "\n",
    "* Whether or not a user has watched a movie in a movie catalog.\n",

    "\n",
    "* One-hot encoding, used to represent categorical data as sparse binary vectors.\n",
    "* Count encoding, used to represent the frequency of words in a vocabulary for a document\n",
    "* TF-IDF encoding, used to represent normalized word frequency scores in a vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas of Study\n",
    "Some areas of study within machine learning must develop specialized methods to address sparsity directly as the input data is almost always sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Natural language processing for working with documents of text.\n",
    "* Recommender systems for working with product usage within a catalog.\n",

    "The solution to representing and working with sparse matrices is to use an alternate data structure to represent the sparse data.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are multiple data structures that can be used to efficiently construct a sparse matrix; three common examples are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dictionary of Keys**. A dictionary is used where a row and column index is mapped to a value.\n",
    "* **List of Lists**. Each row of the matrix is stored as a list, with each sublist containing the column index and the value.\n",
    "* **Coordinate List**. A list of tuples is stored with each tuple containing the row index, column index, and the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also data structures that are more suitable for performing efficient operations; two commonly used examples are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compressed Sparse Row**. The sparse matrix is represented using three one-dimensional arrays for the non-zero values, the extents of the rows, and the column indexes.\n",
    "* **Compressed Sparse Column**. The same as the Compressed Sparse Row method except the column indices are compressed and read first before the row indices.\n",
