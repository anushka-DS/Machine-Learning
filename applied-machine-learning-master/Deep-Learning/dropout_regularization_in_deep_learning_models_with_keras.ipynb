    "A simple and powerful regularization technique for neural networks and deep learning models is dropout.\n",

    "## Dropout Regularization For Neural Networks\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique for neural network models proposed by Srivastava, et al. in their 2014 paper [Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting](http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html) (download the [PDF](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are “dropped-out” randomly. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network. Weights of neurons are tuned for specific features providing some specialization. Neighboring neurons become to rely on this specialization, which if taken too far can result in a fragile model too specialized to the training data. This reliant on context for a neuron during training is referred to complex co-adaptations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine that if neurons are randomly dropped out of the network during training, that other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons. This is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalization and is less likely to overfit the training data."

    "## Dropout Regularization in Keras\n",
    "Dropout is easily implemented by randomly selecting nodes to be dropped-out with a given probability (e.g. 20%) each weight update cycle. This is how Dropout is implemented in Keras. Dropout is only used during the training of a model and is not used when evaluating the skill of the model.\n",

This is a binary classification problem where the objective is to correctly identify rocks and mock-mines from sonar chirp returns. It is a good test dataset for neural networks because all of the input values are numerical and have the same scale.\n",

    "The dataset can be [downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning repository](). You can place the sonar dataset in your current working directory with the file name sonar.csv.\n",

The baseline neural network model has two hidden layers, the first with 60 units and the second with 30. Stochastic gradient descent is used to train the model with a relatively low learning rate and momentum.\n",
