    "# Save and Load Your Keras Deep Learning Models\n",
    "Keras is a simple and powerful Python library for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that deep learning models can take hours, days and even weeks to train, it is important to know how to save and load them from disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, you will discover how you can save your Keras models to file and load them up again to make predictions.\n",

    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "Keras separates the concerns of saving your model architecture and saving your model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model weights are saved to HDF5 format. This is a grid format that is ideal for storing multi-dimensional arrays of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model structure can be described and saved using two different formats: JSON and YAML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we are going to look at two examples of saving and loading your model to file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save Model to JSON.\n",
    "* Save Model to YAML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example will also demonstrate saving and loading your model weights to HDF5 formatted files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples will use the same simple network trained on the Pima Indians onset of diabetes binary classification dataset. This is a small dataset that contains all numerical data and is easy to work with. You can download this dataset and place it in your working directory with the filename “pima-indians-diabetes.csv“.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirm that you have the latest version of Keras installed (v1.2.2 as of March 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Save Your Neural Network Model to JSON\n",
    "JSON is a simple file format for describing data hierarchically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides the ability to describe any model using JSON format with a to_json() function. This can be saved to file and later loaded via the model_from_json() function that will create a new model from the JSON specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are saved directly from the model using the save_weights() function and later loaded using the symmetrical load_weights() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below trains and evaluates a simple model on the Pima Indians dataset. The model is then converted to JSON format and written to model.json in the local directory. The network weights are written to model.h5 in the local directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model and weight data is loaded from the saved files and a new model is created. It is important to compile the loaded model before it is used. This is so that predictions made using the model can use the appropriate efficient computation from the Keras backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is evaluated in the same way printing the same evaluation score."
