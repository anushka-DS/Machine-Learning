    "Subsets of the the rows in the training data can be taken to train individual trees called bagging. When subsets of rows of the training data are also taken when calculating each split point, this is called random forest.\n",

    "New decision trees are added to the model to correct the residual error of the existing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree is created using a greedy search procedure to select split points that best minimize an objective function. This can result in trees that use the same attributes and even the same split points again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is a technique where a collection of decision trees are created, each from a different random subset of rows from the training data. The effect is that better performance is achieved from the ensemble of trees because the randomness in the sample allows slightly different trees to be created, adding variance to the ensembled predictions.\n",
