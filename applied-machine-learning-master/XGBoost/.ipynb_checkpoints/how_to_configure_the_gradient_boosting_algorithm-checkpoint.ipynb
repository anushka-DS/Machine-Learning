    "## How to Configure Gradient Boosting Machines\n",
    "In the 1999 paper “[Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf)“, Jerome Friedman comments on the trade-off between the number of trees (M) and the learning rate (v):\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"The v-M trade-off is clearly evident; smaller values of v give rise to larger optimal M-values. They also provide higher accuracy, with a diminishing return for v < 0.125. The misclassification error rate is very flat for M > 200, so that optimal M-values for it are unstable. …  the qualitative nature of these results is fairly universal.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "He suggests to first set a large value for the number of trees, then tune the shrinkage parameter to achieve the best results. Studies in the paper preferred a shrinkage value of 0.1, a number of trees in the range 100 to 500 and the number of terminal nodes in a tree between 2 and 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1999 paper “[Stochastic Gradient Boosting](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/stobst.pdf)“, Friedman reiterated the preference for the shrinkage parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"The “shrinkage” parameter 0 < v < 1 controls the learning rate of the procedure. Empirically …, it was found that small values (v <= 0.1) lead to much better generalization error.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, Friedman introduces and empirically investigates stochastic gradient boosting (row-based sub-sampling). He finds that almost all subsampling percentages are better than so-called deterministic boosting and perhaps 30%-to-50% is a good value to choose on some problems and 50%-to-80% on others.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"… the best value of the sampling fraction … is approximately 40% (f=0.4) … However, sampling only 30% or even 20% of the data at each iteration gives considerable improvement over no sampling at all, with a corresponding computational speed-up by factors of 3 and 5 respectively.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "He also studied the effect of the number of terminal nodes in  trees finding values like 3 and 6 better than larger values like 11, 21 and 41.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"In both cases the optimal tree size as averaged over 100 targets is L = 6. Increasing the capacity of the base learner by using larger trees degrades performance through “over-fitting”.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In his talk titled “[Gradient Boosting Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPqtzj5VZus)” at H2O, Trevor Hastie made the comment that in general gradient boosting performs better than random forest, which in turn performs better than individual decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Gradient Boosting > Random Forest > Bagging > Single Trees\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 10 titled “Boosting and Additive Trees” of the book “[The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387848576?tag=inspiredalgor-20)” is dedicated to boosting. In it they provide both heuristics for configuring gradient boosting as well as some empirical studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "They comment that a good value the number of nodes in the tree (J) is about 6, with generally good values in the range of 4-to-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Although in many applications J = 2 will be insufficient, it is unlikely that J > 10 will be required. Experience so far indicates that 4 <= J <= 8 works well in the context of boosting, with results being fairly insensitive to particular choices in this range.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "They suggest monitoring the performance on a validation dataset in order to calibrate the number of trees and to use an early stopping procedure once performance on the validation dataset begins to degrade.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Friedman’s first gradient boosting paper, they comment on the trade-off between the number of trees (M) and the learning rate (v) and recommend a small value for the learning rate < 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Smaller values of v lead to larger values of M for the same training risk, so that there is a tradeoff between them. … In fact, the best strategy appears to be to set v to be very small (v < 0.1) and then choose M by early stopping.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as in Friedman’s stochastic gradient boosting paper, they recommend a subsampling percentage (n) without replacement with a value of about 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"A typical value for n can be 1/2, although for large N, n can be substantially smaller than 1/2.\"*"

    "The gradient boosting algorithm is implemented in R as the [gbm package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewing the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/gbm.pdf), the gbm() function specifies sensible defaults:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the vignette for using the gbm package in R titled “[Generalized Boosted Models: A guide to the gbm package](http://www.saedsayad.com/docs/gbm2.pdf)“, Greg Ridgeway provides some usage heuristics. He suggest firs setting the learning rate (lambda) to as small as possible then tuning the number of trees (iterations or T) using cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"In practice I set lambda to be as small as possible and then select T by cross-validation. Performance is best when lambda is as small as possible performance with decreasing marginal utility for smaller and smaller lambda.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "He comments on his rationale for setting the default shrinkage to the small value of 0.001 rather than 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"It is important to know that smaller values of shrinkage (almost) always give improved predictive performance. That is, setting shrinkage=0.001 will almost certainly result in a model with better out-of-sample predictive performance than setting shrinkage=0.01. …  The model with shrinkage=0.001 will likely require ten times as many iterations as the model with shrinkage=0.01\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridgeway also uses quite large numbers of trees (called iterations here), thousands rather than hundreds\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"I usually aim for 3,000 to 10,000 iterations with shrinkage rates between 0.01 and 0.001.\"*"
